- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tanjamie
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science and Analytics, and more specifically Machine Learning (ML)!
- âœ¨ Iâ€™m currently exploring ML algorithms for different task (cv, nlp etc) and methods to handle issues accompanying real data (missing data, imbalanced data etc).
- ðŸ’¾ I'm thrilled to document my growth here while exploring code and doing personal projects! 
- ðŸ¦• Happy coding everyone!
